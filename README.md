# vue-project
Implementing VUE concepts into a small compacted web project
1. Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This
will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise
2. Run npm --save vuex@next and also Run npm --save vue-router@next (to install the 3-rd party packages that im using)
3. Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080
(or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
